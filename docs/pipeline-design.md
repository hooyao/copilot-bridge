# Bridge Pipeline Design

> **2026-06-01 (v0.5) — routing config redesigned nginx-style**: the flat

> **2026-05-31 (v0.4) — routing redesigned around per-model profiles**:
> Wire-truth moved out of `CopilotModelRegistry.EffortAware` (deleted) and
> the live `/models` `CopilotModelCatalog` (deleted) into hand-curated
> `ModelProfileCatalog` entries grounded in playground probes. `Routing.Rules`

> + Anthropic error body instead of silent passthrough. See §7.
>
> **2026-05-08 (v0.3) — three migrations**:
> (a) Routing redesigned. Per-model effort behavior was C# capability data
>     in `CopilotModelRegistry.EffortAware`; `appsettings.json` kept
>     user preferences as `Routing.Rules` (Match → Rewrite). Superseded by
>     v0.4. (b) Logger swapped from the bespoke `DiagTracer`
>     (`[Conditional("BRIDGE_DIAG")]`) to Serilog 4.3.1 (AOT-clean since
>     PR #2175) with console + per-startup file sinks. See §9.
>     (c) `Program.cs` uses `System.CommandLine` 3.0-preview.3 for argument
>     parsing; subcommand handlers are typed entry points instead of
>     `string[]` parsers.
>
> **2026-05-07 (v0.2) — pipeline migration landed**: M1's `/v1/...` endpoints
> deleted; `/cc/v1/...` is the production path; six request stages + one
> response stage assembled in `Hosting/BridgePipelines.cs`.

## 1. Goals

The bridge is **not** "a Claude Code → Copilot proxy" — it's a generic LLM
reverse proxy with a fixed scope: 御三家 (the big three) clients fronting the
two backend shapes Copilot exposes. M1 ships with one client (Claude Code) and
one backend route (Copilot Anthropic), but the architecture is built for the
full set:

- **3 clients**, each on its own URL prefix:
  - Claude Code (Anthropic Messages API) on `/cc/...`
  - Codex (OpenAI Chat Completions / Responses) on `/codex/...`
  - Gemini CLI (Google Gemini API) on `/gemini/...`
- **2 effective backends on Copilot** (not 3 — Copilot does not expose a native
  Gemini-shape endpoint; Gemini models are served through the OpenAI shape):
  - Copilot Anthropic at `/v1/messages`
  - Copilot OpenAI at `/chat/completions` (and `/responses` for o-series)
- **Model substitution**: a client requesting a model the backend doesn't have
  reroutes to an equivalent (e.g. Claude Code asks for `claude-opus-4.8` but
  Copilot only has 4.7 → bridge maps without the client noticing).
- **Bidirectional transformation with feature preservation**: thinking, prompt
  caching, vision, tool calls — preserved across shape boundaries wherever the
  destination has an equivalent. Lossy mappings emit a diag warning, never fail
  silently.
- **Streaming SSE everywhere**: both directions are usually streaming. State-
  ful translators are unavoidable; we centralize where they live.

## 2. Design principles

1. **Strongly typed where possible** — bodies flow through pipelines as typed
   records (`MessagesRequest`, `ChatCompletionsRequest`, etc.), not `JsonNode` or
   `object`. AOT requires it; debuggability rewards it.
2. **One pipeline per (client shape, backend shape) pair** — not one universal
   pipeline. Each pipeline is a typed sequence of stages plus a strategy.
3. **Stages are pure, named, single-purpose** — each stage has a `Name`, mutates
   the context, and is composable in any order the assembly file specifies.
   Stages don't talk to each other except through the context.
4. **Translation between shapes happens at strategy boundaries**, not as a
   middle-of-pipeline stage. A pipeline always operates on one body shape
   end-to-end. If the backend requires a different shape, the strategy owns the
   request and response translators internally.
5. **Routing is data, not control flow** — a `RouteTarget` is selected by the
   `ModelRouterStage` based on the requested model + a registry; the
   `StrategyRegistry` then picks the matching `IUpstreamStrategy`. No `switch`
   statements scattered through the codebase.
6. **Two log channels** — per-request inbound/upstream IO is captured (when
   `Tracing.Enabled`, default off) as four discrete JSON artifacts
   (`request-traces/<utc>-<seq>-{inbound-req|inbound-resp|upstream-req|upstream-resp}.json`)
   through a custom Serilog sink with a bounded back-pressured queue;
   runtime diagnostics go through Serilog (console + always-on per-startup
   file under `log/`), with per-category levels driven by appsettings.json's
   `Logging` section. See §9.
7. **Mirror the official VS Code Copilot Chat client** — for any wire-format
   detail (header set, beta header gating, etc.) follow `chatEndpoint.ts` and
   `dist/index.js` exactly. See `feedback_match_official_copilot_client.md`.
8. **Hub-and-spoke translation, single IR** — pipelines flow on one canonical
   shape (Anthropic Messages API), with adapters at the edges. Pair-wise
   translation between every (client, backend) combination would be a 3×2
   matrix with 4 stateful translators per direction = 8 total; hub-IR collapses
   it to **6 translators** that scale linearly when adding a new client or
   backend. See §3 below.

## 3. Hub-IR translation pattern

> **2026-06-15 — Codex shipped via the hub-IR (`add-codex-responses-client`).**
> An earlier 2026-06-12 note proposed treating Codex as a native-`/responses`
> *passthrough* that skips the IR. **That was superseded** (see
> `docs/codex-implementation-design.md` §1, v2): the hard requirement of
> cross-model substitution — Claude Code using GPT-5, Codex using Opus — means
> routing must happen on a backend-agnostic body, so **every client (Codex
> included) transits the single Anthropic-shape IR** and is routed by model.
> Codex is therefore a real pair of edge translators, not a passthrough:
> **T1** (`ResponsesToIrInboundAdapter`, Codex `ResponsesRequest` → IR) and
> **T4** (`IrToResponsesOutboundAdapter`, IR stream → Responses SSE) on the
> client edge, plus **T2/T3** inside `CopilotResponsesStrategy` (IR → Responses
> wire / Responses SSE → IR). They run on the **same shared
> `Pipeline<MessagesRequest>`**; the strategy registry picks by
> `target.Vendor` (`CopilotAnthropic` → `/v1/messages`, `CopilotResponses` →
> `/responses`). The research's three coercions (per-model `reasoning.effort`
> clamp, `service_tier` strip, `image_generation` drop) live **inside T2**,
> driven by the snapshot-grounded `CodexModelProfileCatalog`. The deliberate
> hub-IR cost — even Codex's own gpt path round-trips through the Anthropic IR
> (`Responses →T1→ IR →T2→ Responses`) — is guarded by the A-invariant
> round-trip tests and proven by a live `codex.exe` end-to-end run (plain +
> tool turns). The §3.3 inventory's `OpenAiToBridge*` rows are now realized as
> these Codex translators. Gemini (M4) remains genuinely IR-translated for the
> same reasons.

### 3.1 The matrix problem

3 client shapes × 2 effective backend shapes = 6 (client, backend) pairs:

|              | Copilot Anthropic | Copilot OpenAI |
| ------------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| Anthropic    | passthrough       | translate      |
| OpenAI       | translate         | passthrough    |
| Gemini       | translate         | translate      |

Pair-wise direct translators = 4 request directions × stateful streaming
machinery + 4 response directions = **8 stateful translators**, each non-
trivial. Adding a fourth client multiplies further.

### 3.2 Hub via Anthropic shape

The pipeline runs on a single **internal representation (IR) = Anthropic
Messages API shape**, materialized as the existing `MessagesRequest` /
`AnthropicMessage` / stream event records under `Models/Anthropic/`. All
adapters land at the IR boundary; all stages run in IR shape only.

Reasons:

- **Most expressive** of the three (cache_control with TTL, three thinking
  variants, multipolar content blocks, context_management edits). OpenAI and
  Gemini features mostly map in; reverse mapping loses fidelity.
- **Hot path is free** — Claude Code → Copilot Anthropic is M1's dominant
  traffic and stays passthrough on both directions.
- **DTOs already exist** from M1 step 3; IR is "free" — no separate IR types
  to design.

**Frozen IR contract (2026-06-15, `freeze-ir-provider-extensions`).** The IR is
now formally frozen — see **[`docs/ir-definition-design.md`](ir-definition-design.md)** §6
for the authoritative contract. In brief:

- IR body = `MessagesRequest` + `MessageParam` + the `ContentBlockParam`
  tagged-union (existing). Reasoning = `ThinkingBlockParam{Thinking,Signature}` /
  `RedactedThinkingBlockParam{Data}` + `OutputConfig.Effort`. Tool input/result =
  byte-faithful `JsonElement`. Streaming IR = the Anthropic SSE event model.
- **The IR body does NOT grow per-provider fields.** Anything a non-Anthropic
  client/backend sends that the body can't type (Codex's `store`, `service_tier`,
  `include`, `prompt_cache_key`, `text.verbosity`, …) rides a namespaced
  escape-hatch — `ProviderExtensions` (`Models/Common/ProviderExtensions.cs`), a
  `provider-name → opaque JsonElement` bag stolen from the Vercel AI SDK's
  `providerOptions` pattern — attached at request and content-part level, opaque
  to the pipeline, copied verbatim. It is `null`/absent for Claude Code, so the
  hot path serializes byte-for-byte as before (proven by the H1 byte-equality
  test).
- The freeze is guarded by the **A-invariant suite**
  (`tests/CopilotBridge.UnitTests/Invariant/`): round-trip self-inverse,
  opaque-field byte-passthrough, bag survival/transport, and hot-path
  byte-equality — asserted on real, de-identified `claude.exe` captures used as
  input samples (never as oracles; `ir-definition-design.md` §7.0).

### 3.3 Translator inventory

Request side (client → IR → backend):

| Direction | Translator | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic client → IR | identity | M1 |
| Codex/Responses client → IR | `ResponsesToIrInboundAdapter` (T1) | ✅ M3 |
| Gemini client → IR | `GeminiToBridgeRequestAdapter` | M4 |
| IR → Anthropic backend | identity | M1 |
| IR → Responses backend | T2 (in `CopilotResponsesStrategy`) | ✅ M3 |

Response side (backend → IR → client; all streaming variants are stateful):

| Direction | Translator | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Anthropic backend → IR | identity | M1 |
| Responses backend → IR | T3 (in `CopilotResponsesStrategy`) | ✅ M3 |
| IR → Anthropic client | identity | M1 |
| IR → Codex/Responses client | `IrToResponsesOutboundAdapter` (T4) | ✅ M3 |
| IR → Gemini client | `BridgeToGeminiResponseAdapter` | M4 |

**Total non-identity translators: 6** (3 in each direction). Each request
transits at most 2. The Codex/Responses set (T1–T4) shipped in M3; Gemini (T?)
is M4. Adding a new client = 1 inbound + 1 outbound adapter; a new backend shape
= 1 of each. Linear growth.

### 3.4 Feature preservation across shapes

| Feature | Anthropic (IR) | OpenAI | Gemini |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reasoning | `thinking:{type:enabled\|adaptive,budget_tokens}` | `reasoning:{effort:low\|medium\|high}` (o-series, gpt-5) | `thinkingConfig:{thinkingBudget:N}` (2.5) |
| Prompt caching | per-block `cache_control:{type:ephemeral,ttl:5m\|1h}` | implicit prefix-match (no annotation) | explicit `cachedContent` resource (out-of-band) |
| Tool definition | `tools:[{name,input_schema,...}]` | `tools:[{type:function,function:{name,parameters}}]` | `tools:[{functionDeclarations:[...]}]` |
| Tool invocation | content `{type:tool_use,id,name,input}` | message-level `tool_calls:[{id,function:{name,arguments}}]` | parts `{functionCall:{name,args}}` |
| Tool result | content `{type:tool_result,tool_use_id,content}` (in user msg) | dedicated `tool` role message with `tool_call_id` | parts `{functionResponse:{name,response}}` |
| Vision | content `{type:image,source:{base64\|url}}` | content `{type:image_url,image_url:{url}}` | parts `{inlineData:{mimeType,data}}` |
| Stop reason | `end_turn \| max_tokens \| tool_use \| stop_sequence \| refusal \| pause_turn \| compaction` | `stop \| length \| tool_calls \| content_filter` | `STOP \| MAX_TOKENS \| SAFETY \| RECITATION` |

Translation rules:

- **Thinking budget ↔ effort**: bidirectional table (`low=4096`,
  `medium=16384`, `high=32768`); `adaptive` ↔ `effort=medium` when no specific
  budget is named.
- **Prompt caching IR → OpenAI**: drop `cache_control` (OpenAI handles
  prefix matching implicitly).
- **Prompt caching IR → Gemini**: M3 drops; M4 may use Gemini's `cachedContent`
  API out-of-band.
- **Prompt caching OpenAI/Gemini → IR**: heuristic — attach `cache_control` at
  end of system block + last block of first user message (Anthropic best
  practice).
- **Stop reason**: simple lookup; unmapped values fall back to `end_turn` with
  a `Log.Warning` diagnostic.
- **Tool result message structure**: Anthropic puts tool_result as a content
  block inside the next user message; OpenAI uses a dedicated `tool` role
  message. Translation maintains the `assistant tool_use → tool_result → user`
  ordering.

Every lossy mapping emits a `Log.Warning(...)` diagnostic so the operator can
surface what was dropped or approximated by tailing the runtime log.

## 4. Core abstractions

### 4.1 BridgeContext

```csharp
internal sealed class BridgeContext<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    public required BridgeRequest<TBody> Request { get; init; }
    public required BridgeResponse Response { get; init; }
    public required RouteTarget Target { get; set; }
    public required CancellationToken Ct { get; init; }

    // Response stages push here when they drop / rewrite individual SSE
    // events; the endpoint merges these into the inbound-resp audit so
    // operators see what was filtered.
    public List<DroppedSseEvent> DroppedEvents { get; init; } = [];
}

internal sealed class BridgeRequest<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    public required string Method { get; init; }
    public required string Path { get; init; }
    /// <summary>Mutable typed body — stages transform this.</summary>
    public TBody Body { get; set; } = default!;
    /// <summary>Mutable header dict — stages add/remove/rename.</summary>
    public Dictionary<string, string> Headers { get; init; } = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
}

internal sealed class BridgeResponse
{
    public int Status { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<string, string> Headers { get; init; } = new(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

    /// <summary>
    /// Streaming responses: an async sequence of SSE events. Stages wrap this
    /// with transforming iterators (drop, mutate, capture). The final consumer
    /// (the writer that flushes to the inbound client) drives the chain.
    /// </summary>
    public IAsyncEnumerable<SseItem<string>>? EventStream { get; set; }

    /// <summary>Non-streaming responses: buffered body. Stages parse / mutate / re-serialize.</summary>
    public byte[]? BufferedBody { get; set; }

    public ResponseMode Mode { get; set; } = ResponseMode.Streaming;
}

internal enum ResponseMode { Streaming, Buffered }
```

**Lifetime — `BridgeContext` is a scoped DI service.** It is registered
`AddScoped<BridgeContext<MessagesRequest>>()`: the container creates one empty shell
per ASP.NET Core request scope, the pipeline-driving endpoint populates it
(`Request`/`Response`/`Ct`/`TraceId`/`InboundBetas`), and every pipeline component
(stages, strategies, adapters, the runner, and the detectors) **constructor-injects
that same instance** rather than receiving it as a method argument. Consequently
`Request`/`Response`/`Ct` are settable (not `required init`) so the endpoint can fill
the DI-created shell, and **a component's constructor MUST NOT read `ctx.Request`** —
it is unpopulated at construction; request data is read only in
`ApplyAsync`/`ForwardAsync`/`Begin`, which the runner invokes strictly after the fill.
See §4.8 for the per-request scope boundary as a whole.

### 4.2 RouteTarget

```csharp
internal sealed record RouteTarget(
    BackendVendor Vendor,
    string Endpoint,           // e.g. "/v1/messages", "/chat/completions"
    string ModelId);           // backend-side model id post-mapping

internal enum BackendVendor { CopilotAnthropic, CopilotOpenAi, CopilotResponses }
```

### 4.3 Stage interfaces

```csharp
internal interface IRequestStage<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    string Name { get; }
    Task ApplyAsync();
}

internal interface IResponseStage<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    string Name { get; }
    Task ApplyAsync();
}
```

Stages inject the scoped `BridgeContext<TBody>` (see §4.1) and read/mutate it in
`ApplyAsync` — `ctx` is no longer a method parameter. `TBody` now only groups
same-shape stages into a `Pipeline<TBody>`.

Most response stages are shape-agnostic in practice (they wrap event streams
or mutate response headers). The `TBody` parameter is there for symmetry and
to give shape-specific stages the option of seeing the typed request that was
just forwarded (useful for "what did we ask for" decisions). Stages that don't
care about `TBody` can be defined as `IResponseStage<object>` and registered
against any concrete pipeline via a thin generic adapter.

### 4.4 Upstream strategy

```csharp
internal interface IUpstreamStrategy<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Inspects ctx.Request (now fully transformed by request stages) and
    /// decides whether this strategy can handle the resolved Target.
    /// </summary>
    bool Matches(RouteTarget target);

    /// <summary>
    /// Performs the upstream HTTP call. Internally may translate the request
    /// body to the backend's native shape (e.g. Anthropic → OpenAI) and wrap
    /// the response stream with a reverse translator. After this returns,
    /// ctx.Response.EventStream / BufferedBody / Headers / Status are populated
    /// in the SAME shape the inbound client expects. Reads the injected
    /// BridgeContext (see §4.1); no ctx parameter.
    /// </summary>
    Task ForwardAsync();
}
```

### 4.5 Pipeline

```csharp
internal sealed class Pipeline<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    public required string Name { get; init; }
    public required IReadOnlyList<IRequestStage<TBody>> RequestStages { get; init; }
    public required IReadOnlyList<IResponseStage<TBody>> ResponseStages { get; init; }
    public required IStrategyRegistry<TBody> Strategies { get; init; }
}

internal interface IStrategyRegistry<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    /// <summary>Picks the first registered strategy whose <c>Matches</c> returns true.</summary>
    IUpstreamStrategy<TBody> Resolve(RouteTarget target);
}
```

### 4.6 PipelineRunner

The runner is what an endpoint handler calls. It's the entry point that drives
the entire request → forward → response flow.

```csharp
internal interface IPipelineRunner<TBody> where TBody : class
{
    Task RunAsync(Pipeline<TBody> pipeline);
}
```

The runner injects the scoped `BridgeContext<TBody>` (it no longer takes it as an
argument). Implementation contract:

```
RunAsync:
    foreach stage in pipeline.RequestStages:
        Log.Debug("req-stage start {Stage}"); apply; Log.Debug("req-stage end {Stage}")
    strategy = pipeline.Strategies.Resolve(ctx.Target)
    Log.Debug("strategy resolved {Name} target={Target}")
    strategy.ForwardAsync()
    Log.Debug("strategy returned status={Status} mode={Mode}")
    foreach stage in pipeline.ResponseStages:
        Log.Debug("resp-stage start {Stage}"); apply; Log.Debug("resp-stage end {Stage}")
    write ctx.Response to outbound (handled by endpoint code, not the runner)
```

### 4.7 Client adapters (the IR boundary)

Adapters live at the boundary between client wire shapes and the IR. They are
NOT part of the stage pipeline — they run **before** request stages and
**after** response stages, transforming `(client shape) ↔ (IR shape)`.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Translates a parsed inbound request body from a client's native shape
/// into the bridge IR. For Anthropic clients the IR shape == client shape;
/// the identity adapter just returns the body unchanged.
/// </summary>
internal interface IClientInboundAdapter<TClientBody, TIR>
    where TClientBody : class
    where TIR : class
{
    string Name { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Parses raw bytes (or a typed body decoded by the endpoint) into the IR.
    /// Headers are read-only context; mutated headers belong on
    /// <see cref="BridgeContext{TIR}.Request"/>.Headers after this returns.
    /// </summary>
    ValueTask<TIR> AdaptAsync(TClientBody clientBody, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> headers, CancellationToken ct);
}

/// <summary>
/// Translates an IR-shape response stream back to the client's native shape.
/// Always async-enumerable to support stateful streaming translators (e.g.
/// IR→OpenAI must accumulate tool_use input_json_delta into a complete
/// argument string before emitting the OpenAI tool_calls chunk).
/// </summary>
internal interface IClientOutboundAdapter<TIR>
    where TIR : class
{
    string Name { get; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Wraps the IR-shape response event stream into a client-shape event
    /// stream. Stages have already finished mutating <c>ctx.Response</c>
    /// before this is invoked. Identity for Anthropic clients.
    /// </summary>
    IAsyncEnumerable<SseItem<string>> AdaptStreamAsync(
        IAsyncEnumerable<SseItem<string>> irStream,
        BridgeContext<TIR> ctx,
        CancellationToken ct);

    /// <summary>
    /// Buffered (non-streaming) variant. Most translators only need to
    /// implement one of the two — the endpoint picks based on
    /// <c>ctx.Response.Mode</c>.
    /// </summary>
    ValueTask<byte[]> AdaptBufferedAsync(byte[] irBody, BridgeContext<TIR> ctx, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

Adapter pairs are registered per (client) and per pipeline; the endpoint
handler picks the right pair based on its URL prefix:

```
/cc/v1/messages    → ClaudeCode adapters (identity for Anthropic shape == IR)
/codex/v1/...      → Codex adapters (translate OpenAI shape ↔ IR)
/gemini/v1/...     → Gemini adapters (translate Gemini shape ↔ IR)
```

Strategy-side translators (IR ↔ backend shape) are an internal concern of the
strategy and do not implement these interfaces — they live as private fields
inside, e.g., `CopilotChatCompletionsStrategy<TIR>`.

### 4.8 Per-request scope boundary (DI lifetimes)

Each forwarded request runs on its own ASP.NET Core request scope, and the whole
pipeline object tree is scoped to it — created at request start, disposed at request
end, fully isolated from concurrent requests. This is a structural guarantee, not a
convention: the boundary is drawn by DI lifetime.

**Scoped (one per request):** `BridgeContext<MessagesRequest>` (§4.1), the six
request stages, both upstream strategies, the four client adapters,
`IPipelineRunner<MessagesRequest>`, `ResponseInspectionStage`, and the five
`IResponseDetector`s (plus the `Pipeline<MessagesRequest>` object itself, composed
per scope by `BuildAnthropicPipeline`). Because these inject the scoped
`BridgeContext`, they *cannot* be singletons — a singleton capturing a scoped service
is a captive dependency.

**Singleton (process-level shared resources):** `HttpClient` and `ICopilotClient` (a
per-request `HttpClient` is the classic socket-exhaustion anti-pattern),
`AuthService`/`IAuthService` (owns the token-refresh timer and in-memory token
cache), the immutable catalog/registry lookup tables (`ModelProfileCatalog`,
`CodexModelProfileCatalog`, `IModelRegistry`), `CopilotHeaderFactory`,
`BridgeIoSink`, `RequestSummaryLogger`, all options, and the hosted services.

**Guardrail.** The host container is built with
`ServiceProviderOptions { ValidateScopes = true, ValidateOnBuild = true }`
(`ServeCommand`). `ValidateOnBuild` walks the whole graph at startup and throws on
any captive dependency; `ValidateScopes` rejects resolving a scoped service from the
root provider. So a future regression that makes a pipeline component a singleton
fails fast at startup and in `DetectorCompositionTests`, rather than silently leaking
one request's state into another. The static routing helpers (`ModelRouteResolver`,
`ProfileAdjuster`, `MatchExpression`) are not DI services; the injecting stage passes
its context to them as an argument — the only place `ctx` still flows as a parameter.

## 5. Request pipeline (current: `Pipeline<MessagesRequest>`)

The endpoint handler parses the JSON body before constructing
`BridgeContext<MessagesRequest>`; there is no separate `InboundCaptureStage`.
The assembled stage list is in `Hosting/BridgePipelines.cs`.

```
inbound bytes (POST /cc/v1/messages)
    │
    ▼  (parsed by endpoint handler into MessagesRequest)
    │
[1] ModelRouterStage              normalize model id; apply matching
                                  Routing.Locations entry (When→Use: model
                                  swap, effort remap, header set/remove);
                                  look up the target's ModelProfile; run
                                  ProfileAdjuster to shape the body to what
                                  the profile accepts; resolve ctx.Target.
                                  See §7.
    │
    ▼
[2] AssistantThinkingFilterStage  drop unsigned thinking blocks from
                                  historical assistant messages
    │
    ▼
[3] SystemSanitizeStage           strip <system-reminder>'s `# currentDate`
                                  and other volatile injections (cache stable)
    │
    ▼

`CacheControlCleanStage` from research §3.6 rule 1 is intentionally absent —
the DTO does not model `cache_control.scope`, so the field is silently dropped
at deserialize time. Add the stage if a `Scope` property is ever introduced.

Body coercions that used to live as the standalone `ThinkingRewriteStage` or
spread across multiple routing-rule entries (haiku adaptive → enabled,
opus-4.7 enabled → adaptive, effort variant routing, beta strips) now live as
data in `ModelProfileCatalog`, applied uniformly by `ProfileAdjuster`. User
`Routing.Locations` express operator preference only (model swap, per-target
effort remap, whitelisted header tweaks) — the target's profile decides every
wire-shape fact. See §7.

## 6. Response pipeline

As-built, the response side is a single stage — `ResponseInspectionStage` — that
runs an ordered set of **scoped** `IResponseDetector`s in one stream wrap
(one SSE parse, fanned out), replacing the earlier one-stage-per-concern layout:

```
ctx.Response.EventStream  (raw events from upstream, or post-translation)
    │
    ▼
ResponseInspectionStage   injected with IEnumerable<IResponseDetector> (each a
    │                     scoped service — one instance per request scope, so
    │                     streaming state never crosses requests). Per request it
    │                     keeps the config-enabled detectors, calls Begin(ctx) on
    │                     each, then renders every event through them in order:
    │
    ├─ DoneFilterDetector          DropEvent on `event:message data:[DONE]`
    ├─ ModelRewriteDetector        RewriteEvent on the first `message_start`
    │                              (and the buffered body's top-level `model`)
    ├─ ResponseLeakDetector        Abort on leaked protocol markup (see §6.1)
    ├─ RunawayGuardDetector        Abort on degenerate response volume
    └─ ToolInputValidationDetector Abort on malformed/schema-invalid tool input
    │
    ▼
endpoint writes ctx.Response.EventStream (streaming) or BufferedBody (buffered)
```

Each detector returns a `DetectionAction` — `None` (pass through), `DropEvent`
(swallow + record in `ctx.DroppedEvents`), `RewriteEvent` (replace payload), or
`Abort` (inject an error and end). The first non-`None` action wins for an event;
`Abort` short-circuits. Detectors never touch the stream — the stage owns the one
async-iterator combinator, so consumption (the endpoint's writer) still drives the
chain lazily. For non-streaming responses `EventStream` is null and detectors run
via `InspectBuffered` over `BufferedBody`.

Detectors are **scoped DI services** (one instance per request scope) because a
streaming detector may carry cross-delta state (the response-leak automaton) that must
not be shared across requests. They are injected as the whole set
`IEnumerable<IResponseDetector>`, and the stage runs them in ascending
`IResponseDetector.Order` — an explicit value assigned at registration (see
§6.3), so **precedence does not depend on the container's enumeration order**. Each
detector self-gates on its own config via `Enabled` (backed by an
`IOptionsSnapshot<T>`), and reads its per-request data (declared tools, model ids)
from the injected `BridgeContext` in a parameterless `Begin()` — the stage calls
`Begin` once, after config-gating and before any inspection, so DI-construction
timing (scope start, body empty) is decoupled from request-data availability
(response phase, body populated). A disabled detector is filtered out before
`Begin`: it is never initialized and never scans.

### 6.1 Response-leak guard

`ResponseLeakDetector` detects a Copilot-served Claude model leaking a tool call as
literal `<invoke name="X">…<parameter…>…</parameter>…</invoke>` XML inside a
`text`/`thinking` block (instead of a real `tool_use` block) and forces Claude
Code to retry the turn cleanly. Detection is **structural** and requires all of:
a closed, balanced `<invoke>…</invoke>` with ≥1 closed `<parameter>`; the tool
name in the request's `tools[]`; and not inside a markdown code fence. It does
**not** key off the drifting prefix token (`court`/`call`), `stop_reason` (both
`tool_use` and `end_turn` observed), or a bare unbalanced `<invoke`.

The same detector also detects a second family of leaks: Claude Code **control /
event envelopes** emitted as literal text — `<task-notification>` (closed, with a
closed `<task-id>` and at least one closed `<summary>`/`<status>`/`<output-file>`
child), `<teammate-message teammate_id="…">`, `<channel source="…">`,
`<cross-session-message from="…">`, and `<tick>…</tick>` (non-empty). Each is
**shape-gated** the same way: closed, required child/attribute present and
non-empty, and not inside a code fence. `<channel>` is distinguished from the
sibling `<channel-message>` wrapper by its exact close tag, so the latter never
trips the guard. Both families share one config, one retry path, and one
detection-point `Warning`.

The scan is a single-pass streaming automaton with O(1) state that retains no
content: one `ResponseLeakAutomaton` owns the shared concerns exactly once — code-fence
tracking, the tripped latch, and the matched subject — and dispatches each character
to a list of bounded, KMP-based matchers: one for the tool-call signature
(`<invoke name="X">…</invoke>`, matched via KMP failure edges with name capture and
`<parameter>` balance counting) and one per control envelope (each proving its
required child/attribute). Every matcher keeps its own independent state; the first
to report a closed, shape-valid signature on a character names the leaked subject,
and a trip is gated on being outside a code fence. A signature split across deltas,
even character-by-character, is carried by automaton state, so an arbitrarily long
leaked block is handled without a window the opening tag could scroll out of.
Runaway name/attribute/inner captures fail open with a bounded buffer.

Two orthogonal knobs (`Pipeline:Detectors:ResponseLeakGuard`): `PreserveStream` (default true —
keep streaming, inject a mid-stream SSE `error` event; false — buffer the whole
response and emit a real HTTP status) × `Signal` (default `OverloadedError` →
`overloaded_error`/529, which Claude Code reliably retries and, after 3
consecutive, falls back opus→Sonnet; or `ApiError` → `api_error`/500). `ScanThinking`
extends both families into `thinking` blocks (which have no fence concept).
Because retry discards the whole attempt (including already-streamed dirty text),
the dirty bytes never commit to the transcript — this breaks the self-reinforcing
poisoning loop. See `docs/copilot-upstream-toolcall-bug-report.md` for the leak's
empirical basis (~2.2% of responses in a poisoned session, all closed/unfenced).

Each signature can be **disabled independently** under
`Pipeline:Detectors:ResponseLeakGuard:Signatures` (`Invoke`, `TaskNotification`,
`TeammateMessage`, `Channel`, `CrossSessionMessage`, `Tick`; all default true) — a
false-positive escape hatch. If the model is legitimately echoing this markup (say
the user is discussing how `<invoke>` tool-use or a `<task-notification>` envelope
works and a sample reply gets caught), turning off just that one signature omits
only its matcher and leaves the rest of the guard active. The tripped signature and
the exact key to flip are named in both the retry error the client receives and the
detection-point `Warning`, so a false positive is self-service to fix. Config is
read at **startup, so a restart is required** after changing a switch. (Hot-reload
is not wired today: each detector already reads an `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` afresh per
request scope, so the only change needed to make a flipped switch take effect live
is registering the JSON file with `reloadOnChange: true` in
`BridgeConfigurationExtensions` — no change to any detector or the stage.)

### 6.2 Tool-input validation

`ToolInputValidationDetector` covers the adjacent failure mode where the model emits
a **real** `tool_use` block, but the accumulated `input_json_delta.partial_json`
fragments close into malformed JSON or an object that obviously violates the
request's declared tool schema. This is distinct from `ResponseLeakDetector`:
there is no leaked `<invoke>` text here; the transport shape is correct, but the
tool arguments would make Claude Code fail the turn with `Invalid tool parameters`.

The detector accumulates fragments for the current tool block and validates only at
`content_block_stop`, when the final JSON object is available. The schema check is
a conservative JSON-Schema subset: top-level input must be an object; declared
`required` properties must exist; declared `object` / `array` / `string` /
`boolean` / `number` / `integer` types must match; and `items` / nested
`properties` are checked recursively. It deliberately does **not** repair bad
arguments or inject dummy values: a missing required value is a model failure, so
the safe behavior is to abort with a retryable Anthropic error and let the client
retry from a clean turn.

Config lives at `Pipeline:Detectors:ToolInputValidation`: `Enabled` (default true),
`PreserveStream` (default true, emit an SSE `error` when the bad block closes;
false buffers the whole response to return a real HTTP status), and `Signal`
(default `OverloadedError` -> `overloaded_error`/529, matching the leak and
runaway guards). Trips set `tool_input_invalid=true` on the per-request summary
line.

### 6.3 Adding a detector

Derive from `AbstractOrderAwareDetector<TSelf>` (CRTP — it carries the `Order`
property and the default members, so you implement only `Name`, `Enabled`, and
`InspectEvent`), and register it with one line in `BridgeServiceCollectionExtensions`
— `services.RegisterResponseDetector<YourDetector>(order)` — in the right
position. `RegisterResponseDetector` registers the detector as a scoped
`IResponseDetector` AND a singleton `DetectorOrder<YourDetector>` holding that
explicit precedence value. Lower order runs first; duplicate detector types or
duplicate order values throw during registration, so precedence stays visible at
the call site and never falls back to `IEnumerable<T>` resolution order. The
detector's constructor injects `DetectorOrder<YourDetector>` (forwarded to
`base(order)`), the scoped `BridgeContext<MessagesRequest>`, and its
`IOptionsSnapshot<T>` config (exposed through `Enabled`); read request data and
reset streaming state in the parameterless `Begin()`. The standard async-iterator
combinator still applies (the stage owns it; a detector only returns a
`DetectionAction`).

For reference, the stage's stream-wrap uses the standard async-iterator combinator:

```csharp
private static async IAsyncEnumerable<SseItem<string>> TransformEvents(
    IAsyncEnumerable<SseItem<string>> source,
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken ct)
{
    await foreach (var evt in source.WithCancellation(ct))
    {
        // ... transform or drop ...
        yield return evt;
    }
}
```

This is the standard async-iterator combinator pattern; consumption (the
endpoint's writer) drives the entire chain lazily.

## 7. Routing semantics

```
inbound (model, effort, thinking, betas, ...)
   ↓ Normalize          canonical id (dotted, no date suffix)
   ↓ User location      appsettings.json Routing.Locations — first-match-wins;
                        applies Use (model swap, effort remap, header set/remove)
   ↓ Profile lookup     ModelProfileCatalog — wire truth for the target model
   ↓ ProfileAdjuster    mechanical body coercion (effort, thinking, betas,
                        mid-conv-system fold, budget cap)
   ↓ Resolve            vendor + endpoint dispatch
outbound to upstream
```

The split is **"profile = fact, location = preference, adjuster = mechanism"**:

- **`ModelProfile`** describes what Copilot's variant of one model actually
  accepts on the wire — the values come from playground probes against
  `/v1/messages` (see
  `tests/CopilotBridge.Playground/ModelProfileProbe.cs`), never from
  Copilot's `/models` metadata (which is incomplete and sometimes wrong:
  haiku-4.5 advertises adaptive thinking but rejects it at runtime). A
  profile is Copilot's behavior, not a preference — users cannot override
  it.
- **`Routing.Locations`** in `appsettings.json` are nginx-style entries:
  each is a self-contained `When` (match expression) → `Use` (change-set)
  closure, scanned first-match-wins. A `Use` may swap `body.model`, remap
  `output_config.effort` (per-target, e.g. `max → xhigh` only where the
  backend accepts xhigh), and set/remove a whitelisted header. This lets an
  operator paper over a stale catalog (Copilot ships opus-4.9, our catalog
  only knows opus-4.8 → redirect 4.9 to 4.8 until we release), pick a
  deliberate fallback (1M-context beta → the dedicated 1M model id), or
  normalize client vocabulary the backend rejects (`effort=max`). Locations
  express **operator preference**; they never override a profile fact (the
  rewritten body still flows through `ProfileAdjuster`).
- **`ProfileAdjuster`** is a pure function `(body, profile) → body` that
  enforces the profile's accepts/rejects: strip unsupported effort, coerce
  unsupported thinking shape, fold mid-conversation `role:"system"`
  messages into the top-level `system` field, cap `budget_tokens`, register
  beta-strip patterns for `HeadersOutboundStage`.

A profile miss is **best-effort, not a hard fail**: `ModelRouterStage` first
tries an exact catalog lookup, and on a miss falls back to the *nearest known
profile* by fuzzy string similarity (`ModelNameMatcher`, Jaccard over character
bigrams). A Copilot model newer than this build's catalog (e.g. a freshly
shipped `claude-sonnet-6`) is therefore **forwarded under the closest known
model's wire contract** — the **real** model id stays on the wire (Copilot has
the model; only our probed profile is missing), and only the coercion rules
(thinking policy, accepted efforts, mid-conv-system, beta strips) are borrowed.
Every fuzzy match is **WARN-logged**: it's a guess, so the operator should
upgrade the bridge (or add an explicit `Routing.Locations` remap) and watch for
unexpected behavior if the borrowed contract doesn't fit. Copilot remains the
final authority — a wrong borrowed shape surfaces as Copilot's own model error.

Only when the requested id is **too dissimilar to any known model** (below the
`ModelNameMatcher.DefaultMinSimilarity` floor — typically a typo or a foreign
vendor prefix) does the bridge fall back to the old behavior: throw
`UnknownModelException` → 400 + Anthropic-format error body naming the nearest
rejected candidate and its score, plus how to fix it (add a routing rule, fix
the typo, file an issue). The borrowed profile never rewrites the model id: if
a borrowed profile used `EffortHandling.RouteToVariant`, the stage neutralizes
it to `Strip` so a sized-sibling id that may not exist for the new model is
never substituted.

> **Why this inverts the earlier "never guess" principle.** The old design
> fail-closed to avoid a *silent* Copilot 400. But the real model id is always
> what's sent, so a genuinely-new model just works; a mis-borrowed contract
> produces Copilot's own (visible) error, not a silent one; and the similarity
> floor still gives a crisp, actionable error for true typos. Net: new models
> work out of the box, typos still fail loudly.

### 7.1 Vendor + endpoint dispatch — `IModelRegistry.Resolve`

Pure name normalization + prefix-based dispatch in `CopilotModelRegistry`:

| Prefix | Vendor | Default endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-*` | CopilotAnthropic | `/v1/messages` |
| `gpt-*`, `o3-*`, `o4-*`, `gemini-*` | CopilotOpenAi | `/chat/completions` |

`Normalize` canonicalizes the inbound id:

- Strips a trailing 8-digit date suffix (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` → `claude-sonnet-4-5`)
- Merges the first consecutive `digit-digit` pair into `digit.digit`
  (`claude-opus-4-7` → `claude-opus-4.7`,
  `claude-opus-4-7-1m-internal` → `claude-opus-4.7-1m-internal`)

`Resolve` returns `null` for unknown prefixes; the runtime stage throws a
descriptive error in that case.

### 7.2 Model profile catalog — `ModelProfileCatalog`

The wire-truth table. One `ModelProfile` per Copilot Anthropic model id,
hand-curated in `Pipeline/Routing/ModelProfileCatalog.cs`. After the 2026 model
reconciliation the catalog covers 7 models (every Claude id Copilot still
exposes on this account: haiku-4.5, sonnet-4.5, sonnet-4.6, **sonnet-5**,
opus-4.6, opus-4.7, opus-4.8). The reconciliation **retired** opus-4.5,
opus-4.6-1m, and the opus-4.7 -high/-xhigh/-1m-internal variants — all now 400
"not available for integrator" (`ModelProfileProbe.RetiredCandidate_LivenessProbe`).
The values are sourced from the corresponding probe rows in
`ModelProfileProbe.cs` — re-run that test after Copilot ships or changes any
model, then reconcile.

```csharp
internal sealed record ModelProfile
{
    public required string CanonicalId { get; init; }

    // Effort values accepted as-is. Empty = backend rejects the field outright.
    public IReadOnlyList<string> AcceptedEfforts { get; init; } = [];

    // What to do with an inbound effort not in AcceptedEfforts:
    //   Strip            — drop the field; model falls back to its default.
    //   RouteToVariant   — re-target body.model to a sized sibling id
    //                      (e.g. opus-4.7 + high → opus-4.7-high).
    public EffortHandling EffortOnUnsupported { get; init; } = EffortHandling.Strip;
    public IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> EffortToVariant { get; init; } = …;

    // Which thinking shapes the backend takes, and how to coerce the others.
    public ThinkingPolicy Thinking { get; init; } = ThinkingPolicy.AdaptiveOnly;
    public int MaxThinkingBudget { get; init; } = 64000;

    // opus-4.8 and sonnet-5 accept the protocol extension in legal placements
    // (pred=user, succ=assistant-or-end); every other model rejects it — see
    // the cross-cutting facts below.
    public bool AcceptsMidConversationSystem { get; init; }
    public bool AcceptsSpeedFast { get; init; }

    // anthropic-beta tokens to strip from the outbound header set when this
    // profile is the active target (e.g. `context-1m-*` on the dedicated 1M
    // model ids, which subsume the beta).
    public IReadOnlyList<string> StripBetas { get; init; } = [];
}

internal sealed record ThinkingPolicy
{
    public required IReadOnlyList<string> AcceptedShapes { get; init; }
    public required string CoerceToWhenUnsupported { get; init; }
    public bool DeriveBudgetFromEffortOnEnabled { get; init; }
    public bool DeriveEffortFromBudgetOnCoerce { get; init; }

    // Three named presets cover today's catalog. Add more as needed.
    public static ThinkingPolicy AdaptiveOnly { get; } // opus-4.7, opus-4.8, sonnet-5
    public static ThinkingPolicy EnabledOnly  { get; } // haiku-4.5, sonnet-4.5
    public static ThinkingPolicy All          { get; } // sonnet-4.6, opus-4.6
}
```

Cross-cutting facts the probe surfaced and the catalog encodes (re-probed in
the 2026 reconciliation):

- **Effort acceptance is per-model and non-monotonic.** opus-4.7 / opus-4.8 /
  sonnet-5 accept `low/medium/high/xhigh/max`; opus-4.6 / sonnet-4.6 accept
  `low/medium/high/max` but reject `xhigh` (max works where xhigh 400s);
  haiku-4.5 / sonnet-4.5 reject the effort field entirely. So `max` is stripped
  only on the models that reject it, not universally.
- **opus-4.8 and sonnet-5 accept non-first `role:"system"` messages** in legal
  placements (predecessor=user; successor=assistant or end-of-array); every
  other model rejects the extension with `"Unexpected role 'system'"`. So
  `AcceptsMidConversationSystem` is `true` for those two and `false` elsewhere,
  and the §7.3 handler keeps legal placements / converts illegal ones when
  `true` and converts unconditionally when `false`. (sonnet-5 mid-conv support
  contradicts Anthropic's "opus-4.8 only" docs — it was confirmed by live probe.)
- **`thinking.budget_tokens` must always be less than `max_tokens`** or
  Copilot 400s on that constraint before evaluating the shape at all.

### 7.3 Body coercion — `ProfileAdjuster.Apply`

Pure function over `(BridgeContext, ModelProfile, ModelProfileCatalog)`,
applied in order:

1. **Effort + variant routing.** If `body.output_config.effort` isn't in
   the profile's `AcceptedEfforts`, either drop the field (`Strip`) or
   rewrite `body.model` to a sized sibling id from `EffortToVariant`
   (`RouteToVariant`). A variant rewrite switches profiles — the adjuster
   continues against the new profile's contract for the remaining steps.
2. **Thinking shape coercion.** If `body.thinking.type` isn't in
   `AcceptedShapes`, coerce to `CoerceToWhenUnsupported`. When coercing
   enabled→adaptive and the policy says so, carry the inbound
   `budget_tokens` forward into `output_config.effort` first (so the
   user's reasoning depth survives). When the coerced shape lands on
   enabled, derive `budget_tokens` from effort using the standard
   mapping (low=4096, medium=16384, high=32768, xhigh=64000).
3. **Mid-conversation system fold.** When the profile rejects
   `role:"system"` messages outside the first slot, collect their text
   blocks, drop the messages from `body.messages`, and append the text to
   `body.system`. Preserves order. Without this, 4.8 → 4.7 fallback (or
   any 4.8 request at all on Copilot, per §7.2) would 400 on
   `Unexpected role 'system'`.
4. **Budget cap.** Clamp `thinking.budget_tokens` to
   `MaxThinkingBudget`.
5. **Beta strip registration.** Append the profile's `StripBetas`
   patterns to `ctx.PendingBetaStrips` so `HeadersOutboundStage` removes
   them from the outbound `anthropic-beta` header. A global
   `advisor-tool-*` strip is also registered here unconditionally —
   Claude Code 4.8 sends `advisor-tool-2026-03-01` by default and
   Copilot's gateway 400s on it (`unsupported beta header(s)`), so it's
   dropped for every model regardless of profile.

The adjuster never decides what's a user preference vs a fact — by the
time it runs, the user rule has already picked the target profile, and
every adjustment from there is fully determined by the profile's
documented behavior.

### 7.4 User routing locations — `appsettings.json` `Routing.Locations`

Loaded via standard `IConfiguration` / `IOptions<T>` at startup. Validated by
`RoutesValidator` before Kestrel binds the port. **No hot reload** — edit and
restart.

Modeled after nginx `location { ... }`: a request matches at most one entry
(first-match-wins, no chain, no fall-through), and that entry's `Use` is the
complete change-set applied to the request. Each location is a self-contained
closure — everything that should happen for "this kind of request" lives in
one block.

Schema:

```jsonc
{
  "Routing": {
    "Locations": [
      {
        "When": { "Model": "gpt-5.5-1m" },
        "Use": { "Model": "gpt-5.5" },
        "Note": "Codex alias: gpt-5.5-1m -> gpt-5.5 (sidesteps Codex's client-side context cap)"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**`When` — the match expression** (`Pipeline/Routing/MatchExpression.cs`). A
small JSON-native tree, no custom DSL:

| Node | Form | Semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Model` | `"claude-opus-4.8"` | Exact (case-insensitive) match on the canonical model id. |
| `Effort` | `"max"` | Exact match on `output_config.effort`. |
| `Header` | `{ "Name": "...", "Eq" \| "Contains": "..." }` | Header match. For `anthropic-beta` the inbound representation is the parsed token set, so `Contains` is token-containment (with trailing `*` wildcard) and `Eq` is "this exact token is present". |
| `AllOf` | `[ … ]` | AND — every child must match. |
| `AnyOf` | `[ … ]` | OR — at least one child must match. |

Top-level `Model` / `Effort` / `Header` are **implicitly AND-ed** (the 80%
case needs no `AllOf` wrapper). There is **no `Not`** — negation is a
readability footgun; write two locations instead. An empty `When` matches
everything (a catch-all), but `RoutesValidator` rejects empty `AllOf`/`AnyOf`
arrays as authoring slips.

**`Use` — the change-set.** At least one field is required (an empty `Use` is
rejected):

| Field | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Model` | Replace `body.model` (canonical id). |
| `EffortMap` | `{ inbound: outbound }` — per-target effort remap, applied **after** the model swap, so a map like `{"max":"xhigh"}` is scoped to the resolved target (only meaningful on ids that accept xhigh). |
| `Headers.Set` | `{ name: value }` — set/replace a whitelisted header. For `anthropic-beta` the value is split into tokens and merged into the outbound set (`PendingBetaAdds`). |
| `Headers.Remove` | `[ "X-Foo", "anthropic-beta:context-1m-*" ]` — plain entries drop the whole header; the `name:pattern` form drops matching `anthropic-beta` tokens (trailing `*` wildcard). |

**Header whitelist.** `Headers.Set` / `Headers.Remove` only accept
`anthropic-beta`, `Editor-Version`, `Editor-Plugin-Version`,
`Copilot-Integration-Id`, `X-GitHub-Api-Version`. Any other name fails
startup validation — bridge-internal protocol headers (`Authorization`,
session/machine/device ids, the vision flag) are off-limits so a config
typo can't produce silent 401s. Identity-header overrides thread through
`BridgeContext.CopilotHeaderOverrides` into `CopilotHeaderFactory`;
`anthropic-beta` add/remove flows through `HeadersOutboundStage`.

Today's `appsettings.json` ships an **empty** active location list
(`"Locations": []`) — no rewrites by default — plus a **disabled** example under
`_Locations_disabled` (a key the config binder ignores; enable by renaming it to
`Locations`):

| `When` model | `Use.Model` | `Use.EffortMap` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `claude-opus-4.8` | `gpt-5.5` | `max` → `xhigh` |

Note:
- The example routes Claude Code's `claude-opus-4.8` to Copilot's `gpt-5.5`. The
  `EffortMap max→xhigh` is required because Claude Code sends the Anthropic effort
  `max`, which gpt-5.5 (a Codex model) does not accept; mapping it at the routing
  layer is the operator's explicit intent (versus T2's per-model `DefaultEffort`
  fallback, which also lands on `xhigh` but emits a "not accepted" WARNING). It
  ships disabled because gpt-5.5 is a lossy fit for the Claude Code tool protocol
  (see `docs/gpt55-runaway-diagnosis.md`).
- Earlier releases shipped an active `gpt-5.5-1m → gpt-5.5` Codex context-window
  alias here (naming the model `gpt-5.5-1m` with `model_context_window=1000000`
  sidesteps a client-side context cap Codex applies to the literal `gpt-5.5`; the
  bridge maps it back so Copilot's natively-1M `gpt-5.5` is used, `Normalize`
  keeping the `-1m` suffix). It was removed when the active list was emptied.

**Retired: the opus 1M redirects.** Earlier releases shipped
`"opus 4.x + 1M beta → dedicated 1M model id"` redirects (opus-4.7/4.8 →
`claude-opus-4.7-1m-internal`, opus-4.6 → `claude-opus-4.6-1m`). The 2026
reconciliation removed both: Copilot **retired** the `-1m-internal` / `-1m`
target ids (they 400 "not available for integrator"), and the opus-4.6 / 4.7
**base** ids now serve 1M context natively (a >600k-token prompt returns 200 —
`ModelProfileProbe.OpusBase_LargePrompt_ProbeOneMillionContextSupport`), same as
opus-4.8 and sonnet-5. So the 1M beta now passes through to the base model
unchanged; no redirect (and no `StripBetas`) is needed.
- No `claude-haiku-4.5 + 1M`, `claude-sonnet-4.6 + 1M`, etc. locations are
  needed: Copilot has no 1M variant for those families, and the bridge
  refuses to invent one. The inbound beta passes through to Copilot,
  which 400s with its own message — the user's signal to either drop
  the beta or pick a 1M-capable model.

### 7.5 Unknown-model error path

When `ModelRouterStage` looks up the post-normalize, post-location model id in
`ModelProfileCatalog` and finds nothing, it throws
`UnknownModelException` carrying the inbound model id, the resolved id, the
matching location (if any) plus its index, and the full known-profile list.
`ClaudeCodeMessagesEndpoint` catches the exception and writes:

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "[copilot-bridge] No profile for model 'claude-opus-4.9' …"
  }
}
```

The message is Anthropic's standard error envelope (so clients that already
handle `invalid_request_error` display it correctly) with a
`[copilot-bridge]` prefix and one of two diagnostic templates:

- **Client sent unknown model**: lists known profiles + a JSON snippet the
  operator can paste into `appsettings.json` to redirect.
- **A location's `Use.Model` target is unknown**: cites the offending
  `Routing.Locations[i]` (by index + its `Note`) and asks the operator to
  fix it or add an earlier location that remaps the resolved id.

`ModelRouterStage` also `Log.Error`s the same diagnostic so it lands in
the bridge's runtime log without needing the client transcript.

### 7.6 Refreshing the catalog when Copilot changes

The probe → catalog refresh cycle:

1. Run `tests/CopilotBridge.Playground/CopilotGapProbes.DumpClaudeModelsAndCapabilities`
   to see what Copilot exposes on the current account.
2. Run `tests/CopilotBridge.Playground/ModelProfileProbe.Thinking_ProbeAcceptance`,
   `Effort_ProbeAcceptance`, and `MidConversationSystem_ProbeAcceptance`
   for the full per-model matrix. The error messages tell you which
   values are accepted (e.g. `"supported values: [low medium high]"`).
3. Reconcile `Pipeline/Routing/ModelProfileCatalog.cs` against the
   results. Each entry's field should map back to a row in the probe
   output — don't extrapolate from family names; sibling models surprise
   you (haiku-4.5 ≠ sonnet-4.6 on thinking; opus-4.7-1m-internal accepts
   four efforts but its base only accepts one).

A future Copilot model can land as a hard error first (the bridge refuses
the request with a clear 400) and then as a profile after probes confirm
the wire shape. This is by design — silent breakage is worse than an
explicit "I don't know this model yet."

## 8. Per-client URL prefixes

Each client is mounted on its own URL prefix. This eliminates body sniffing
entirely — the URL **is** the client identity.

| Prefix | Client | Inbound shape | Endpoints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/cc/v1/...` | Claude Code | Anthropic Messages | `messages`, `messages/count_tokens`, `models` |
| `/codex/v1/...` (M3) | Codex | OpenAI Chat Completions / Responses | `chat/completions`, `responses`, `models` |
| `/gemini/v1/...` (future) | Gemini CLI | Google Gemini | `models/.../generateContent`, etc. |

`Endpoints/` becomes shape-organized:

```
Endpoints/
  ClaudeCode/
    ClaudeCodeMessagesEndpoint.cs            # POST /cc/v1/messages
    ClaudeCodeCountTokensEndpoint.cs         # POST /cc/v1/messages/count_tokens
    ClaudeCodeModelsEndpoint.cs              # GET  /cc/v1/models
    ClaudeCodeEndpoints.Map(app);            # registers all of the above
  Codex/                                     # M3+
    CodexChatCompletionsEndpoint.cs
    ...
```

Configuration impact: Claude Code's `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` environment variable
must be set to `http://localhost:8765/cc` (note the `/cc` suffix), so its
client appends `/v1/messages` and lands on our `/cc/v1/messages`.

## 9. Logging

Two log channels, both flowing through a single Serilog pipeline configured
once in `Program.cs`.

> **See also:** [`docs/observability-design.md`](observability-design.md) — the
> full observability subsystem design: the four-artifact audit trace, trace-id
> correlation, raw upstream capture, and the `RequestAudit` gating seam, with
> mermaid diagrams. This section is the concise reference; that doc is the map.

### 9.1 Per-request IO audit (opt-in, four files per request)

**Off by default.** The audit captures full request and response bodies —
including user prompts — so it's gated behind a config toggle:

```jsonc
"Tracing": {
  "Enabled": false,              // flip to true to capture; restart to apply
  "Directory": "request-traces"  // relative to the .exe unless absolute
}
```

When `Enabled` is false (the default), `Program.cs` never constructs the
`BridgeIoSink` and the audit sub-logger is skipped entirely — no files, no
channel, no background writer. The startup banner says `Req trace: disabled`.
The separate Serilog **text** log (`<exe-dir>/log/bridge-<stamp>.log`,
startup banner + stage debug + errors) is always on; only the per-request
JSON capture is opt-in.

When enabled, each inbound request produces **four** JSON files in
`<exe-dir>/request-traces/` (or the configured `Directory`), sharing a stamp
so they're trivially groupable:

```
20260521-143205-0042-inbound-req.json     ← what Claude Code sent us
20260521-143205-0042-upstream-req.json    ← what we forwarded to Copilot
20260521-143205-0042-upstream-resp.json   ← what Copilot returned
20260521-143205-0042-inbound-resp.json    ← what we sent back to Claude Code
                                            (including dropped SSE events)
```

`<seq>` is a process-wide monotonic counter (`BridgeIoSeq.Next`); the inbound
and upstream halves of one request share it. The four artifacts are
intentionally separate files (not one combined record) so an operator can
load a single side into an editor without bringing along megabytes of the
streaming response. (Note: `log/` = always-on text log, `request-traces/` =
opt-in per-request JSON — two distinct directories.)

#### Pipeline

```
endpoint
   │  logger.LogInboundRequest (seq, method, path, headers, body)
   │  logger.LogUpstreamRequest (seq, method, url, headers, body)
   │  logger.LogUpstreamResponse(seq, status, headers, body)
   │  logger.LogInboundResponse (seq, status, headers, body, events?, error?, durationMs)
   ▼
ILogger<T> (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)
   ▼   one entry per call, EventId in {1001..1004}, state =
   ▼   IEnumerable<KVP<string,object?>> { ("Payload", BridgeIoPayload) }
   ▼
Serilog.Extensions.Logging bridge
   ▼   LogEvent.Properties["Payload"] = ScalarValue(BridgeIoPayload)
   ▼
Serilog logger split (Program.cs):
  .WriteTo.Logger(lc => lc
    .Filter.ByIncludingOnly(e => e.Properties.ContainsKey("Payload"))
    .WriteTo.Sink(BridgeIoSink))
  .WriteTo.Logger(lc => lc
    .Filter.ByExcluding(e => e.Properties.ContainsKey("Payload"))
    .WriteTo.Console(...)
    .WriteTo.File(...))
   ▼
BridgeIoSink (custom ILogEventSink, Hosting/Logging/BridgeIoSink.cs)
   │  Emit(LogEvent) extracts Payload, drops it into a bounded Channel.
   │  Channel: capacity=256, FullMode=Wait → producer (request thread)
   │           blocks when full = real back-pressure on the request side.
   ▼
Worker task (single reader)
   ▼  pretty-prints to <utc>-<seq>-<kind>.json (using JsonNode tree;
   ▼  body is parsed as JSON when possible, falls back to string)
   ▼  the payload body is a plain array, reclaimed by GC (the sink does not pool)
```

#### Buffer ownership

Endpoints read inbound bodies into a pooled buffer (a
`Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream`, pooled chunks) to avoid per-request LOH
allocation churn on conversation-sized payloads, via the shared
`InboundBody.ReadPooledAsync` helper which returns a disposable `PooledBody`.
The endpoint consumes the body **synchronously** (deserialize + the audit
capture) inside a `using`, so the pooled storage is returned to the manager within
the endpoint's synchronous section — it does **not** cross `await` into the
pipeline (the request context has no raw-bytes field for a stage to read). When
tracing is on, `RequestAudit.RecordInbound` makes a one-shot copy for the sink;
that copy is a plain payload-owned array, distinct from the pooled read buffer.

The sink-owned body buffer is a plain array reclaimed by GC after the audit JSON
is written; the sink does not pool or return it.

#### Redaction

`Authorization`, `X-Api-Key`, `Anthropic-Auth-Token` header values are
replaced with `<redacted>` before serialization. Bodies are not scrubbed
(the wire bodies don't contain OAuth tokens; those flow only through the
`/login/device/*` endpoints which never enter the bridge audit path).

#### Shutdown

`AppDomain.ProcessExit` calls `Log.CloseAndFlush()`, which disposes the
custom sink. Dispose:

1. `_channel.Writer.TryComplete()` — no more payloads will be accepted.
2. `_worker.Wait(5s)` — drain the queue naturally.
3. On timeout, cancel the worker token and wait another 1s — panic flush.

So pending IO audits land before the process exits, even on Ctrl+C.

### 9.2 Runtime log — Serilog console + per-startup file

Non-IO events (stage debug lines, startup banners, framework noise from
Kestrel / Routing / Hosting.Diagnostics) flow through Serilog's standard
sinks:

- **Console** (`Serilog.Sinks.Console` 6.1.1) — mirrors to **stderr** from
  level Verbose+. Stderr (not stdout) so it doesn't interleave with the
  device-code OAuth banner.
- **File** (`Serilog.Sinks.File` 7.0.0) — writes to
  `<exe-dir>/log/bridge-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.log`. One file per process start
  (no rolling). Each restart gets its own file; old files accumulate
  until the operator cleans up.

Output template:
`{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss.fff} [{Level:u3}] {Message:lj}{NewLine}{Exception}`.

#### Level filtering — driven by appsettings.json

Serilog's own minimum is `Verbose` (everything in). Per-category filtering
is delegated to `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` via `appsettings.json`'s
`Logging` section (the slim host wires this up automatically when
`SerilogLoggerProvider` is the only MEL provider — see `KestrelServer.cs`'s
`builder.Logging.ClearProviders(); AddProvider(new SerilogLoggerProvider(...))`):

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "CopilotBridge.Cli": "Debug",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel": "Warning"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Known gap**: the bridge's own code still uses the static `Serilog.Log.Debug(...)`
> API in places, which bypasses MEL filtering and is always emitted (subject
> only to Serilog's own minimum). Converting all static calls to injected
> `ILogger<T>` is mechanical but not yet done.

#### AOT footprint

Serilog 4.3.0+ closes the IL2072 trim warning. The destructuring path
(`{@Property}`) reflects on `obj.GetType()`'s public properties; we use the
plain message-template path everywhere, so trimming is clean. Verified by
`dotnet publish` with 0 warnings.

### 9.3 Startup auth flow

Before opening the listening socket, `BridgeHost.RunStartupAsync`:

1. Validates `Routing.Locations` (`RoutesValidator`). On failure: log error,
   exit code 2.
2. `auth.EnsureGitHubTokenAsync(ct)` — if `auth.IsAuthenticated` is false,
   logs `[INF] No GitHub token on disk — starting device-code flow`, then
   the injected `PrintDeviceCode` callback writes the verification URL +
   user code to stdout. `EnsureGitHubTokenAsync` **blocks** polling GitHub
   until the user completes the browser handshake; the token is then
   DPAPI-encrypted and saved next to the .exe.
3. `auth.GetCopilotTokenAsync(ct)` — exchanges the GitHub token for a
   short-lived Copilot bearer token, started the in-memory refresh timer.
4. `ModelProfileCatalog` is a static DI singleton (hand-curated, no
   network call) — startup just logs its profile count and ids. The
   catalog deliberately does **not** derive from Copilot's `/models`
   metadata; see §7.2 for why.

Net behavior: a fresh checkout / fresh machine just runs `copilot-bridge
serve` and the operator pastes the device code into their browser; no
separate `auth login` step is required. `auth login` still exists for
operators who want to handshake offline before starting the server.

## 11. Evolution path

### 11.1 Adding a new client (e.g. Codex)

1. Define `Models/OpenAi/ChatCompletionsRequest.cs` (and friends).
2. Add `Endpoints/Codex/CodexEndpoints.cs` mounting `/codex/v1/...`.
3. Add `Pipeline/Stages/OpenAi/` with OpenAI-specific stages
   (CodexInboundCaptureStage, CodexModelRouterStage, ...).
4. Build `Pipeline<ChatCompletionsRequest>` in `Hosting/BridgePipelines.cs`.
5. Register Codex strategies in the strategy registry.

The pipeline framework, runner, response stages, audit log — all reused.

### 11.2 Adding a new backend route (e.g. Anthropic client → OpenAI backend)

1. Add a new strategy class:
   `Pipeline/Strategies/OpenAi/CopilotChatCompletionsTranslateFromAnthropicStrategy.cs`.
   Inside it: `IBodyTranslator<MessagesRequest, ChatCompletionsRequest>` and
   `IStreamTranslator<OpenAiSseChunk, AnthropicSseEvent>`.
2. Register it in `Pipeline<MessagesRequest>`'s strategy registry, matching
   targets where `BackendVendor == CopilotOpenAi`.
3. Update `CopilotModelRegistry`'s prefix dispatch (or add a new entry to
   `ModelProfileCatalog`) so the relevant model ids resolve to that vendor.

Pipeline stages, audit log, endpoints — all reused.

### 11.3 Substituting a model alias (the explicit override)

When Copilot ships a model the bridge has no profile for yet, it is
**forwarded automatically** under the nearest known profile (see §7 —
best-effort fuzzy matching), with a WARN log. The operator only needs to act if
they want to override that automatic choice — e.g. pin a new id to a *specific*
known model rather than whichever the matcher picks. They do so with a redirect
location in `appsettings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "When": { "Model": "claude-opus-5" },
  "Use":  { "Model": "claude-opus-4.8" }
}
```

The redirect is a user-visible knob: the operator can confirm a specific
fallback works for their workload, and remove the location once the bridge ships
a real `ModelProfile` for the new id. The fuzzy matcher is the default;
`ModelNameMatcher` uses Jaccard similarity over character bigrams with a
family-then-version tie-break, so it already prefers the same-family, highest
-version sibling — the redirect is for when the operator wants a *different*
target than that.

Stage: `ModelRouterStage` normalizes the inbound id, runs the location matcher
to apply the `Use` change-set, looks up the target profile (exact, then nearest
via fuzzy match), and runs `ProfileAdjuster`. Only if the resolved id is too
dissimilar to *any* known model — below the `ModelNameMatcher` floor — does the
bridge 400 with a message naming the nearest rejected candidate (and, if a
routing location produced the id, the offending `Routing.Locations[i]`).

## 12. Migration plan from current code

> **Completed 2026-05-07** — kept as a record. The unprefixed `/v1/...`
> endpoints described as "current" below were deleted; `/cc/v1/...` is the
> production path. The `DiagLog`/`BRIDGE_DIAG` machinery referenced in step 2
> was later replaced by Serilog (see §9; `BRIDGE_DIAG` no longer exists in
> the csproj). The `BridgeRequestLog` / `BridgeRequestLogger` types
> mentioned in step 2 were subsequently rewritten as a custom Serilog sink
> (`BridgeIoSink`) with four ILogger extension methods and per-request
> ArrayPool-backed JSON files — see §9.1.

The starting state (M1 step 6a) had `Endpoints/MessagesEndpoint.cs`,
`Endpoints/ModelsEndpoint.cs`, `Endpoints/CountTokensEndpoint.cs` registered at
unprefixed paths (`/v1/messages`, etc.) with inline logic.

Migration steps (one PR per step preferred):

1. **Build pipeline framework** (everything in `src/CopilotBridge.Cli/Pipeline/`):
   container, stage interfaces, runner, registry types, **adapter interfaces**
   (`IClientInboundAdapter`, `IClientOutboundAdapter`), DiagLog. No stages, no
   strategies, no concrete adapters, no endpoint changes. Compile + AOT clean
   (the unused framework gets trimmed away by the AOT linker).
2. **Wire DiagLog through** the existing `BridgeRequestLogger`: add a `Diag`
   field on `BridgeRequestLog` and emit a `diag` JSON section if non-null. Add
   `BRIDGE_DIAG` to `<DefineConstants>` in the Debug configuration.
3. **Implement Claude Code identity adapters** (`ClaudeCodeInboundAdapter`,
   `ClaudeCodeOutboundAdapter`) — they're trivial passthroughs for M1 (Anthropic
   shape == IR) but establish the integration pattern.
4. **Implement M1 stages** under `Pipeline/Stages/Anthropic/`. Each stage one
   PR or one logical group of PRs. Some are passthrough (do nothing) for now —
   build the box, fill it incrementally.
5. **Implement `CopilotMessagesPassthroughStrategy`** moving the HTTP call
   logic out of `MessagesEndpoint.cs` into the strategy.
6. **Implement `CopilotModelRegistry`** under `Pipeline/Routing/` with the
   alias table; wire it into `ModelRouterStage`.
7. **Build the Claude Code endpoint set** under `Endpoints/ClaudeCode/`,
   mounted at `/cc/v1/...`. Handlers are thin: parse → adapter.AdaptAsync →
   build context → run pipeline → adapter.AdaptStreamAsync → write outbound.
8. **Update `.claude/settings.local.json`** to set
   `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8765/cc`.
9. **Delete the old endpoints** (`Endpoints/MessagesEndpoint.cs` etc.) once
   `/cc/v1/...` is verified end-to-end.
10. **Re-run the harness prompts** (`tests/harness/prompts/`) and the playground
    tests. All must still pass.

Throughout the migration, the audit log shape is preserved (existing log
format remains compatible). Diag log is additive (new section in the JSON).

## 13. Open questions / future revisions

- **Where does the request body parsing happen** — in the endpoint handler or
  inside `InboundCaptureStage`? Current proposal: in the stage, so the parsing
  rules (which `JsonContext`, which polymorphism settings) live in the
  pipeline rather than the endpoint. Endpoints become near-trivial wrappers.
- **Should `IResponseStage<TBody>` ever need to see the typed request body?**
  Examples: a stage that adds a downstream-shaped trailing event based on what
  was requested. Current decision: yes — `TBody` is in scope for symmetry, and
  most stages will ignore it.
- **Do stages need configuration objects?** For now no — all M1 stages have no
  per-instance state. If we add e.g. a `RateLimitStage`, configuration enters.
  At that point introduce `IRequestStage<TBody, TConfig>` or a sealed
  `StageOptions<TStage>` pattern.
- ~~**Diag log for production debugging** — currently `[Conditional]` strips
  it from Release.~~ **Resolved (v0.3)**: Serilog now logs in Release too;
  level is controlled at runtime via `BRIDGE_LOG_LEVEL`. No build-time gate.
